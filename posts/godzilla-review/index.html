I can&rsquo;t wait for the movie with King Ghidorah. The male and female mutos looked very scary even though I&rsquo;ve seen them before. They looked like a cross between a T-rex and a insect.</p>
<p>In the middle of the movie my dad asked if the mutos were Mothra, I said &ldquo;No, Mothra looks like a giant butterfly or moth.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s why she&rsquo;s called Mothra.</p>
<p>My favourite part was when Godzilla did his first beam of blue fire.  My least favourite part was when the main character&rsquo;s mom died from radiation poisoning.</p>
<p>I think people who have watched Jurassic Park can handle Godzilla, though I think it was less scary.</p>

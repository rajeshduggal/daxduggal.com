Dragonoid Maximus
Review! 


By Dax Duggal


The Dragonoid Maximus Bakugan is full of 
many surprises. 


A bakugan is a ball you roll on a Bakucore 
to open. However, Dragonoid Maximus isn’t an 
ordinary bakugan.


He is an Evo (an evolution of a bakugan) and a bakugan 
at the same time. But he acts like a bakucore (a hexagon shaped magnet to power up and open your bakugan) 
You can also use action cards to power up your bakugan.


Dragonoid doesn’t close into a ball. He folds into an irregular shape. When you drop a bakugan on a closed Dragonoid Maximus, he opens and roars. His chest lights up too! There’s a cool yellow robotic design on 
his chest.  


 


I like Dragonoid Maximus because he is very detailed and very powerful. He has 2500 B power! That's maybe the most B power ever! It also comes with Titan Dragonoid which has 700 B power, one of the highest B power of regular bakugan! (The second last Evo of Dragonoid.)




The only thing I don’t like about Dragonoid Maximus is that he has manual parts (parts you have to move yourself), his horn and his neck. But if you keep your hand where you drop a bakugan you don’t have to move his neck!


My favorite bakugan are: Lupitheon Ultra, Howlkor Ultra, Maxotaur Ultra, Nillious Ultra, Phaedrus Ultra, Hydranoid Ultra, Kelion Ultra, Garganoid Ultra, Cyndeous Ultra, Trox Ultra, and Skorporos Ultra.

Today I had ice cream! The flavour was roasted marshmallow. I had it in a cup with a cone on top. First I wanted a sugar cone, but then my mum told me it would start melting again. So, I got a cup with a cone. It was really yummy, and it had no drips.  Next time I would get the other one to try. I don't remember the name but I know it was related to caramel. And I would also get a large rum raisin for my dad. Because he loves ice cream too.


My sister had plain old chocolate gelato... boring!!!

My mum got lemon sour cream gelato.  My sister traded with my mum.  When we got on the street car to come home it started to rain. When we came off of the street car it stopped raining, we didn't feel a single drop. And then we had to come a looong way from King station to Finch, and we finally got home.

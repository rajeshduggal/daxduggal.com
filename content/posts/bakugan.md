My Bakugan are interesting.  The names are: Aurelus Hydorous, Aquos Serpenteze Ultra, Ventus Nillious, Darkus Serpenteze, Aurelus Fangzor, Pyrus Mantonoid Ultra, and Ventus Pegatrix. 

They all have abilities, weaknesses, and attacks.  There's two types of Bakugan. Bakugan Battle Brawlers, and Bakugan Battle Planet.

In Bakugan Battle Planet the winner depends on the B-power and the attack powers. For Bakugan Battle Brawlers it's a little complicated.  So the winner depends on the Gs. If the winner has five hundred more Gs, the winner takes the other person's Bakugan in the show.

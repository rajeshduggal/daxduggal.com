In the future I'm going to make a giant candy. It's going to have cotten candy, chocolate, caramel, mint, strawberry ice-cream, and if my dad will buy it, I'll put rum raisin ice-cream in, instead of strawberry.

It is going to be one hundred feet long! And the shape will be a tube. It will be so yummy that I'm going to add anything you want.

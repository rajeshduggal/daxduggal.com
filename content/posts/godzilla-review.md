The first Godzilla movie was not so scary, and there was a lot of action in it. I can't wait for the movie with King Ghidorah. The male and female mutos looked very scary even though I've seen them before. They looked like a cross between a T-rex and a insect.

In the middle of the movie my dad asked if the mutos were Mothra, I said "No, Mothra looks like a giant butterfly or moth." And that's why she's called Mothra.

My favourite part was when Godzilla did his first beam of blue fire.  My least favourite part was when the main character's mom died from radiation poisoning.

I think people who have watched Jurassic Park can handle Godzilla, though I think it was less scary.

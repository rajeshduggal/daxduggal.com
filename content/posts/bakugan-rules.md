# Basic Starter Pack Rules
## Game Set Up
* Bakugan
	* Each player has three Bakugan for the game.
* Character Cards
	* Each Bakugan has a corresponding character card. Which should be placed face down.
	* Place each Bakugan, closed, on top of its character card.

* BakuCores
	* For each character card, look at the top right corner for the two symbols. And gather a BakuCore for each of those types.

* Hide Matrix
	* Each player takes a turn placing a BakuCore. It must be placed face down. Every BakuCore must have at least one side flush with another BakuCore's side.
	* Randomly choose who places a BakuCore first.
	* There should be 12 total BakuCores used to form the Hide Matrix.


## The Roll
* When a Bakugan wins a brawl it is placed open on its character card.
* Each player takes a Bakugan that has yet to win a brawl (i.e. a closed Bakugan).
* When rolling the Bakugan, use the arrow tip on the Bakugan to roll it in the correct orientation.
* From at least two card lengths away, they roll their Bakugan towards the matrix at the same time. 
* If neither Bakugan open, then they both roll again.


## The Brawl (At least one Bakugan opens)
* Winning Bakugan are kept open and placed back on its character card. Losing Bakugan are closed on their character cards.
* If a player's Bakugan opens, they turn over their Bakugan character card.
* If only one player's Bakugan opens they are the winner of the brawl.
* If both Bakugan opens on a BakuCore they combines the character cards B score and the BakuCore B score. The highest total score wins the brawl. If the totals are equal then the player with the highest attack power (fist symbols on the BakuCore + Character card) wins. If the attack powers are the same the players roll their Bakugan again.


## How to Win
* The first player to win a brawl with each of their Bakugan wins the game.
